# Tensorflow_regression

This repository contains a simple example of linear regression implemented in TensorFlow. The code demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using gradient descent optimization and visualize the regression line.

Features:
- Simple linear regression model with TensorFlow
- Gradient descent optimization for model training
- Visualization of the regression line with matplotlib

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install TensorFlow and matplotlib using pip: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib`.
3. Run the provided example code to train the linear regression model and visualize the regression line.
